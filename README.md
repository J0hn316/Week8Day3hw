# WEEK 8 Day 3 Homework

Intro
In the State & Props in React lesson, you saw how to:

Initialize state using useState
How to pass info as props from a parent to a child component
How to map arrays of info to components
How to use function components to render info provided as props
Time for some practice repeating what you know about React so far!

Minimum Requirements

1.  Use the following array of "student" data to initialize state as an object with a students key in the <App>component:

2.  Code the <App>App component to display a <Student>component for each student object in the student sarray being held in state.
    Code the <Student>component so that it:

        Renders the student's name& bio properties
        Renders a <Score>component for each score object in the student's scores property.

3.  Code the <Score>component so that it renders the score object's date& score properties.
